The KDD dataset is a collection of network intrusion detection system (NIDS) data, and the features in the dataset can be categorized as follows

Basic features
duration the duration of the connection in seconds.
protocol_type the protocol used in the connection, such as TCP or UDP.
service the type of service requested in the connection, such as http or ftp.
flag the status of the connection, such as FIN or SYN.
Traffic features
src_bytes the number of data bytes sent from the source to the destination.
dst_bytes the number of data bytes sent from the destination to the source.
land a boolean value indicating whether the connection is fromto the same hostport.
wrong_fragment the number of wrong fragments (i.e., fragments with a bad checksum) in the connection.
urgent the number of urgent packets in the connection.
hot the number of hot indicators in the connection.
num_failed_logins the number of failed login attempts.
logged_in a boolean value indicating whether the user is logged in.
num_compromised the number of compromised conditions.
root_shell a boolean value indicating whether a root shell was obtained.
su_attempted a boolean value indicating whether the user attempted to escalate privileges.
num_root the number of root accesses.
num_file_creations the number of file creation operations.
num_shells the number of shell prompts.
num_access_files the number of operations on access control files.
num_outbound_cmds the number of outbound commands in an ftp session.
is_hot_login a boolean value indicating whether the login belongs to the hot list (i.e., a list of users who have been suspected of system penetration).
is_guest_login a boolean value indicating whether the login is a guest login.
Connection features
count the number of connections to the same host as the current connection in the past two seconds.
srv_count the number of connections to the same service as the current connection in the past two seconds.
serror_rate the percentage of connections that have SYN errors.
srv_serror_rate the percentage of connections to the same service that have SYN errors.
rerror_rate the percentage of connections that have REJ errors.
srv_rerror_rate the percentage of connections to the same service that have REJ errors.
same_srv_rate the percentage of connections to the same service.
diff_srv_rate the percentage of connections to different services.
srv_diff_host_rate the percentage of connections to different hosts for the same service.
dst_host_count the number of connections to the same destination host in the past two seconds.
dst_host_srv_count the number of connections to the same service on the same destination host in the past two seconds.
dst_host_same_srv_rate the percentage of connections to the same service on the same destination host.
dst_host_diff_srv_rate the percentage of connections to different services on the same destination host.
dst_host_same_src_port_rate the percentage of connections from the same source port to the same destination host and port.
dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate the percentage of connections to different hosts for the same service on the same destination host.
dst_host_serror_rate the percentage of connections to the same destination host that have SYN errors.
dst_host_srv_serror_rate the percentage of connections to the same service on the same destination host that have SYN errors.
dst_host_rerror_rate the percentage of connections to the same destination
